I'm a Founding Engineer at Corgi Insurance (YC S24) with a Master's in Electrical Engineering from Utah State University (4.0 GPA). I joined as the 5th engineer and was promoted to Lead Engineer, then Head of Engineering for subsidiary Beagle. I've architected core API infrastructure enabling 300,000+ residents, built billing systems processing $100M+ in transactions, and led teams to deliver mission-critical features under aggressive timelinesâ€”including a new billing flow that closed a $3M+ deal within 2 days.

Previously, as CTO at Talsey AI, I led development of AI-driven messaging systems with LLM-based chatbot workflows, architected migration to microservices (reducing deployment times by 40%), and built ML infrastructure on AWS SageMaker with event-driven Kafka processing. I also served as a Computer Scientist at Hill Air Force Base, where I designed unified development environments adopted across the Air Force F22 program and Lockheed Martin, led RHEL 9 migrations, and built secure DevOps CI/CD pipelines adhering to DoD security protocols.

With expertise spanning full-stack development, cloud architecture (AWS/GCP), ML/AI (PyTorch, TensorFlow, LLMs), and distributed systems, I excel at building scalable, high-impact solutions from the ground up.
