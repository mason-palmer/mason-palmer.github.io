I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a Master’s in Electrical Engineering from Utah State University (4.0 GPA) and over 3 years of experience building scalable, AI-driven solutions. I excel in designing and deploying deep learning models using PyTorch, TensorFlow, and OpenCV, and I’ve architected robust distributed systems with microservice paradigms, Apache Kafka, and RabbitMQ. As CTO at TalseyAI, I boosted user engagement by 20% through innovative NLP, computer vision, and recommendation system implementations while integrating cutting-edge LLMs and vector databases. My background in full-stack development, AWS cloud services (including SageMaker), and agile cross-functional collaboration positions me to drive impactful, real-world AI solutions.
